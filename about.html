              Thamini is a Swahili word meaning “value” or “to value” and I feel it sums up my personal ethos: what I aim to offer you and what I hope you will get from our time together.
              I hope that our time together will be of great value to you and that it will enable you to resolve the difficulties and challenges that have led you to counselling.
              One of the ways that I hope to facilitate this is by valuing you as a person, completely and without judgement. This means that my regard for you, the way I view you, is unconditional.  It is not based on your identity, status, race, religion, gender, sex, sexual orientation, class, age or the issues that you bring to the therapy session.
              I work in a ‘person-centred way’, meaning that I do not direct you or deign to be the expert of your life. Instead, I hope that by building a relationship with you through understanding you as deeply as I can, by being open, trusting and trustworthy, you can find ways to resolve the difficulties you have and fulfill your potential

   <p style="padding-top:30px;">All reasonable requests for this information will be answered promptly
  I have an Enhanced DBS that enables me to work with children, young people and adults. Available on request.<br></p>
  I work from a ground floor office that is accessible to wheelchair users or anyone else who needs it. <br>
  <p style="padding-top:7px">

    If you are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, although I am not able to provide you with an interpreter,<br> you are welcome to you to bring your own.
  </p> 
<br>
  <p style="padding-top:7px">Recognising that not everyone is able to move around as freely as they would like to, I work face-to-face or online.
  For continuity of work, I will use the same mode for each client. Clients can either come to my office,
   or I can work with them in their own homes. Again, for continuity of work, we will be bound to either having sessions at my office or at your home. 
   Should you need to move your counselling sessions to my office from your home, 
  I can accommodate that, subject to timings
