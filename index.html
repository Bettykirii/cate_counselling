  <p style="padding-left:50px;overflow:hidden">I am committed to providing counselling in a warm, safe, confidential and accepting environment. where you can explore your thoughts and feelings to find ways of coping with a specific issue causing you distress, personal disquiet, discomfort or vulnerability, or to see things more clearly. My aim is to work with you to enable you to tap into the power within, see things differently, enhance your life and live more fully. 

    A part of my role is helping you to explore your thoughts, feelings and behaviours. I believe that through self-discovery comes greater self-awareness. With greater awareness comes greater choice. With greater choice comes the freedom and courage to embrace life and all its potentialities; to move away from aspects of your life you are not happy with, or to keep them, but within a changed perspective where you feel you have exercised agency and you are in control.

    My approach as a ‘Person-Centred’ counsellor is based on the work of Dr. Carl Rogers (1902 – 1987) who believed that individuals find fulfilment of their personal potentials in an environment where a person felt free from threat, both physically and psychologically, which could be achieved by being in a relationship with a person (counsellor) who was deeply understanding (empathic), accepting (having unconditional positive regard) and genuine (congruent) (The Person-Centred Association - TPCA) https://www.the-pca.org.uk/)

    I believe you are the expert in a life that is uniquely yours and I do not wish to hold any power-over you but to follow where you wish to lead. I hope to facilitate you to use our time together in therapy for what you need, whether that is for increased self-understanding, to feel heard, supported and understood, or to look at specific experiences and their impact on your life or anything else that you may want to bring. This need may not be clear and will be part of an ongoing discussion and may very well change over the course of therapy. That too is okay, because only you truly know your pain and what you need to focus on.

  I think of therapy as walking through tall bushes, having to clear the brush along the way. Sometimes the path is clear, and we walk through easily. Other times we cannot see where we are going, and we have to push the bushes aside to clear a path. I see myself as being there, beside you, holding down the tall grass as you set it aside, so you can see ahead. 

  In other instances, though the path looks clear; no bushes, no tall grass, it is littered with thorns, some so small we can barely see them, and yet they hurt so bad. In those times, I will try my best to walk with you as you tread gingerly; fearfully picking your way through, having to face things that you may have kept hidden, but which have caused you much distress. I will trust that you can find a way through, that you can harness your innate force towards growth even as I understand that it may not be easy or straightforward. I will be sensitive, empathic and accepting of you, even of those parts of you that may seem so terrible to you or to society.

  <p style="padding-left:50px;">
    (Rogers, 1961, p.17).
    Accepting yourself just as you are does not mean you are content to stay as you are. It means looking at yourself without defence, denial, facades or rationalisations. This openness can help release the power and potential inside of you and can lead to transformation and meaningful change. In order to move away from what we do not like, we have to be willing to accept that of ourselves. You may then make the changes you want in your life or find that you are okay with being as you are. The key thing is that those decisions now come from within you, feel right for you and for making connections with others.
