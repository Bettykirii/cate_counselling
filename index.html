  <p style="padding-left:50px;overflow:hidden">I am committed to providing counselling in a warm, safe, confidential and non-judgemental environment where<br> you can explore your thoughts and feelings to find ways of coping with a specific issue, <br>generalised “disquiet” or to see things more clearly. My aim is to work with you to enable you to enhance your life and to live it more fully.
  
  </p><br>
  <p style="padding-left:50px;" >
      A part of my role is helping you to explore why you think, feel and behave the way that you do. <br>Through self-discovery comes greater self-awareness. With greater awareness comes greater choice. With greater choice comes the freedom to change the things you are not happy with, or to keep them,<br> but within a changed perspective where you feel you have exercised agency. 

  </p><br>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"  >
    As a Person-Centred Counsellor, I work with you, as a whole person.<br> I believe you are the expert in a life that is uniquely yours and I do not wish to hold any power-over you but to follow where you wish to lead, <br>I hope to facilitate you to use our time together in therapy for what you need, whether that is for increased self-understanding, or to feel heard, supported and understood, or to look at specific experiences <br>and their impact on your life or anything else that you may want to bring. This need may not be clear and will be part of an ongoing discussion and may very well change over the course of therapy. <br>That too is okay, because only you truly know where your pain is, and what you want to focus on.

</p><br>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"  >
    I think of therapy as walking through tall bushes, having to clear the brush along the way.<br> Sometimes the path is clear, and we walk through easily. Other times we cannot see where we are going, and we have to push the bushes aside to clear a path.<br> I see myself as being there, beside you, holding down the tall grass as you set it aside, so you can see ahead. 


</p><br>
<p style="padding-left:50px;"  >
    In other instances the path looks clear; no bushes, no tall grass, but it is littered with thorns,<br> some so small we can barely see them, and yet they hurt so bad. In those times, I will walk with you as you tread gingerly; fearfully picking your way through, having to face things that you may have kept hidden,<br> but which have caused you so much distress. I will trust that you will find a way through. I will be empathic and accepting of you, <br>even of those parts of you that may seem so terrible to you and to society. 

</p><br>
<p style="font-style: italic;text-align:right"> <q>The curious paradox in life is that when I accept myself as I truly am, <br>then I can begin to change
    
    </q> <br> Carl Rogers 
  </p><br>
  <p style="padding-left:50px;">
    Accepting yourself just as you are does not mean you are content to stay as you are. It means looking at yourself without defence,<br> denial, facades or rationalisations. This openness releases the power inside of you leading to transformation and lasting change. <br>You are then able to make the changes you want in your life or gain contentment to be and stay where you are.
