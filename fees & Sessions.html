        <p style="padding-left:50px;">
          Each session lasts 50 minutes. We can have weekly, fortnightly or whichever frequency is of mutual satisfaction. The length of therapy (number of sessions) is open-ended and flexible. We will discuss how long you want to carry on. You are not bound to stay. If and when you feel you need to stop, I will respect your choice to end therapy. 
        We will cover holidays, unexpected breaks, cancellations, notice periods and endings during our contracting in the first session as well as your needs and expectations. 

          </p>
        <h1 style="padding-left:50px;">Fees statement</h1>
        <p style="padding-left:50px;">
          I charge between £30 and £50 per hour for therapy and this is negotiable, depending on both our circumstances. 
          I offer a concessionary rate to students and those on low incomes, please let me know during our first contact, so we can agree a mutually practicable fee. 
          Payment can be by cash, cheque, PayPal, mobile payments, or Gocardless
          I understand how daunting it can feel to start counselling and how crucial it is that we both feel comfortable with the counselling relationship and working together.
          <p style="padding-top:15px;padding-left:50px"> When you have never seen a therapist before, it is sometimes difficult to envision what therapy is, what it can do for you or whether this is the right time for you to start.
          For this reason, I offer the first session free of charge, with no obligation to take up counselling with me. In this session, I will explain in more detail how I work and you can ask any questions you may have. This allows you to make an informed decision about what I offer, if it feels right for you and if it meets your needs. You may choose not to carry on; if you later change your mind, you are of course welcome to come back.
