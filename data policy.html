<h3>
    Confidentiality and Privacy Statement:
</h3>


        <h3 style="text-align:left;padding-left:20px;">Sessions:</h3>
       <p style="padding-left:20px"> I am a member of and regulated by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and I am bound by their Ethical framework. 
        Anything we talk about within the counselling room will be confidential. One exception to this is set by Law, and it concerns the risk of immediate and <br>serious harm to yourself or others, money laundering, terrorist activity or certain traffic offences. <br>In most of these instances, I will discuss with you before I contact the relevant authorities as required by law. Where I will be forced by Safeguarding, either of yourself or others, to discuss with others,<br> I will do my best to keep confidential those parts of our time together that do not need to be disclosed to prevent serious harm. <br>
        I take seriously my own personal and professional development and to do this, I need the support of a Clinical Supervisor, who is also a therapist,highly qualified and experienced. They too are bound by the same confidentiality rules and regulations that I am. In order to work as effectively, safely and ethically as possible,I will discuss some of my work with my clients with her/him but this will be anonymised and will not have any identifying information. 
        To make sure that I am complying with rules and regulations set out by my registration body, the BACP, an audit of my work will be carried out periodically. <br>This too will not include any identifiable personal information. <br>
        
        

       <h3 style="text-align:left;padding-left:20px"> Record-keeping:</h3>
        <p style="padding-left:20px">Inline with the GDPR, and ICO, I will collect essential information about you, <br>but only that which helps in creating a unique record for our work together,<br> ie name, contact, next of kin (in case of emergencies). 
        All identifying information will be collected and stored in the strictest of confidence, and I will endeavour to keep adequate, relevant and limited. 
        Any physical information collected on you will be stored in a securely locked cupboard in my office for which only I will hold the keys.
        Any information recorded electronically will be stored in a computer with up to date security protection and a password for which only I have access.
        Any notes I take of our sessions will be anonymised and stored in a securely locked cupboard for which only I have access.<br> They will contain only very brief and factual descriptions of our session to help me gauge and reflect on our time together. <br>No names or identifying information will be present and you can request and have access to these records at any time.
