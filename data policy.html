<h3>
    Confidentiality and Privacy Statement:
</h3>


        <h3 style="text-align:left;padding-left:20px;">Sessions:</h3>
       <p style="padding-left:20px;padding-top:15px"> I am a member of and regulated by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and I am bound by the “Ethical Framework for Counselling Professions” (2018)
        Anything we talk about within the counselling room will be confidential. The exception to this is Statutory obligations to disclose concerns around the risk of immediate and serious harm to yourself or others. These are contained in: The Terrorism Act 2000, s.38B; Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015; Drug Trafficking Act 1994; Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; s.21 of the Road Traffic Act 1991; Money Laundering Regulations 2007; s.50 of the Children Act 1989;  Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 (as amended by section 74 of the Serious Crime Act 2015); The Children Act 1989 (CA 1989), in conjunction with subsequent legislation including the Children Act 2004. (BACP, 2019) 
        In most of these instances, I will discuss with you before I contact the relevant authorities. Where I will be forced by safeguarding, either of yourself or others, to disclose, I will do my best to keep confidential those parts of our time together that do not need to be disclosed to prevent serious harm. 
        . 
        
        <p  style="padding-left:20px;padding-top:15px">
          I take seriously my own personal and professional development and to do this, I need the support of a Clinical Supervisor, who is also a therapist; highly qualified and experienced. They too are bound by the same confidentiality rules and regulations that I am. In order to work as effectively, safely and ethically as possible, I will discuss some of my work with clients with him/her/them but this will be anonymised and will not have any identifying information. 
          Further, to make sure that I am complying with rules and regulations set out by my registration body, the BACP, an audit of my work will be carried out periodically. This too will not include any identifiable personal information
          



        </p>

       <h3 style="text-align:left;padding-left:20px;padding-top:15px"> Record-keeping:</h3>
        <p style="padding-left:20px">Inline with the  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), (Intersoft Consulting, 2018), the Data Protection Act 2018, (https://www.gov.uk) and Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) (https://ico.org.uk/); I will collect essential information about you, but only that which helps in creating a unique record for our work together, ie name, contact, next of kin (in case of emergencies). 
          All identifying information will be collected and stored in the strictest of confidence. Any information collected in physical form will be stored in a securely locked cupboard in my office for which only I will hold the keys.
          Any information recorded electronically will be stored in a computer with up to date security protection and a password for which only I have access.
          Any notes I take of our sessions will be anonymised and stored in a securely locked cupboard for which only I have access. They will contain only very brief and factual descriptions of our session to help me gauge and reflect on our time together. No names or identifying information will be present and you can request and have access to these records at any time. 
          All records will be kept throughout our time together and upto 7 years later. After which they will be destroyed.
          
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="text-align:left;padding-left:20px;padding-top:15px"> Clinical Will:</h3>
        <p style="padding-left:20px">
        
          In case of anything happening that renders me incapacitated, I have appointed in my clinical will a professional who will contact you, and who will also be responsible for disposing of all records, in line with good practice and the law.
